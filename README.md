# Implementation of the [Synacor](https://challenge.synacor.com/) challenge 
## warning - files contain spoilers

To solve the challenge i implemented the VM and a series of utility programs.
The solution to the first part is found in `part1.txt`, and the solution to
the last part in `part2.txt`. A complete discription of how to reach the end is
found in `debugger-commands.txt`. A disassembled version of the program
at before the 7th code is found in `challenge.s`, which also contains a few
comments.
